When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to create a remote repository if you plan to work from multiple locations or if
    multiple people may work on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might want to pull changes manually so that your code won't change unless you ask for it.    

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branches divert from the master branch on a local repository.
    clones are copies of a repository and can be local or remote
    forks are copies of repositories on github to your github repository while maintaining credit to original.

    branches are useful when you want to add new changes to a repository while maintaining
	quick references to earlier versions. Cloning repositories allow you to work independantly
	from the original. Forking on GitHub allow you to make a copy that you have access rights to change.
 	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    by having a copy of the last known state of the remote, you have access to the lastest changes.
    You can perform the merge off-line at your leisure.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    If i was to collaborate with other users on a coding project without the use of Git/GitHub (or any other
    version control utilities) I would probably insist that we work from a single location and only allow
    one user to access a file at a time. This would prevent users from overwriting each others changes, but it
    would not allow muliple people to work at the same time(at least on the same file).

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
